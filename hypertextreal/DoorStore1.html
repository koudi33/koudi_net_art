    <h1>The Door Store</h1>
<p>Four walls makes a room, but a poor one at best.
<br>No sun can enter, no rays to bless
<br>Unless for the hermit, the prisoner, the bat
<br> Four walls alone are for no one, you're better than that
<br> <br> You need a change. You've been meaning to get out for a long time. 
<br>The pale off-white walls are starting to whisper just loud enough that you can hear them.
<br>You were never meant to succumb to that. Mama raised you better. Fate knows better.
<br>Your legs wobble as you lift yourself off of your mattress. You weren't expecting that.
<br> Perhaps you've forgotten just how long you've been staring into the off-white...
<br><br><h2>It's time to go to the Door Store </h2>
<br><br>Shopping for doors is a chore, but one you must do.
