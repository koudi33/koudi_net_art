<title>Door Store Final</title>

<body>
    <h1>You've reached the end</h1>
Perhaps you weren't ready for such a long chore
<br>Perhaps shopping for doors was a bore
<br>Perhaps what you wanted was something more
<br>Perhaps you were never at the door store...
<br><br>Wait a minute....
<br>
<h2>How could you leave for the door store if you didn't have a door in the first place?</h2> 
<br>Were all the adventures you had in your head?
<br>Were all the sights, sounds, and smells just shadows dancing upon your off-white walls?
<br><br>Maybe you should've taken a trip to the pheumatic drill store instead...
<h3>NO!</h3>
You won't let it end like this. Your mama raised you better. Fate knows better.
<br>You slam your body onto the plaster.
<br> <h4>Screw buying a door--you're making your own...</h4>
